⚠️⚠️ Important Notes⚠️⚠️

🚨 This script makes significant changes to your system's configuration. Always review the script before running it.
🧪 It's highly recommended to run this script on a fresh installation or a test system before applying it to a production environment.
🚫 After running the script, it will ask you to disable root login via SSH and create a non-root user with a password. Make sure to carefully copy down the non-root username and password, and have it saved and ready before you load the script. The script will ask you for the new password twice to ensure accuracy.
🔑 The same caution applies if you decide to set up an SSH keypair or Google Authenticator. It is extremely important to copy this information down before you close the terminal; otherwise, you will lose access to your server.
🔢 If you choose to change the SSH port, make note of the new port number to avoid losing access to your system.
💾 Ensure you have backups of all important data before running the script.
🛠️ Some features (like LUKS encryption) are placeholders and require manual setup or customization.
